This repository consists for necessary codes for the authors' DS 340W group project: Health Insurance Fraud Detection. 

There are two codes available: DS_340W_ParentPaper_Code_FINAL.ipynb and DS_340W_Week_1_Code_FINAL.ipynb.

DS_340W_ParentPaper_Code_FINAL.ipynb provides codes that resemble the results presented in the parent paper. It attempts to clean/reassemble the data and calculate model accuracies for the four different machine learning methods. 

DS_340W_Week_1_Code_FINAL.ipynb provides codes that consists of both parent paper results and our own novelty. It clean/reassemble the data in similar way as the parent paper code, conduct exploratory data analysis, and calculate model accuracies for the seven different machine learning methods. 

The authors created this code in Google Colab, so it is recommended for readers to view the code in the same platform.
